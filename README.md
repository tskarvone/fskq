# Usage

Clone or download the repository and add `fskq` directory to your MATLAB search path. The three numerical experiments of the article (as well as some additional illustrations) are in the `examples` directory. The file `demo.m` contains some simple examples that demonstrate how to use the MATLAB functions.

# Contributors

Most of the code is written by the authors. The function `fskq/fss.m` is partly based on a MATLAB Central [answer](https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/newsreader/view_thread/164470) by Bruno Luong and the function `fskq/spgetseq.m` is taken from the [Sparse Grid Interpolation Toolbox](http://www.ians.uni-stuttgart.de/spinterp/) by Andreas Klimke.
